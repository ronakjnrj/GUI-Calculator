 ## ðŸ§® GUI Calculator using Python & Tkinter
This project is a Graphical User Interface (GUI) Calculator developed using Pythonâ€™s built-in tkinter library. It was designed as a hands-on practice project to strengthen my understanding of core Python concepts while also learning how to build interactive desktop applications.

The calculator replicates the basic functionality of a standard physical calculator, allowing users to perform arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with ease. It features a clean and intuitive user interface, responsive buttons, and dynamic result display â€” all handled using event-driven programming with tkinter.
